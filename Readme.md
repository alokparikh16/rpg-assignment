## Assignment 
Develop a web application using Vue 3 and Node.js (preferred Nest.js) with a GraphQL integration. 
The application should have the following features:
- User authentication: The application should allow users to create an account and log in.
- Blog creation: Users should be able to write simple blog posts consisting of just plain text.
- Real-time notifications: Whenever a new blog is published by any user, all the users on the platform should be notified in real-time (without requiring a page reload) in the application itself.

Once the application is complete, please upload it to a public GitHub repository and share the link with us.

### NOTE
This project has been set up with Vue3 (Not Nuxt 3) and Nest.js with Graphql. It has a hello world graphql and REST endpoint.
