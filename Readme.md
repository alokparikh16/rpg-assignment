## Assignment 
The application should have the following features:
- User authentication: The application should allow users to create an account and log in.
- Blog creation: Users should be able to write simple blog posts consisting of just plain text.
- Real-time notifications: Whenever a new blog is published by any user, all the users on the platform should be notified in real-time (without requiring a page reload) in the application itself.

To match our current technical stack, we prefer the solution using:
- Vue 3
- Node.js (preferred Nest.js)
- GraphQL

However, we will accept projects that use other tech stacks.

### NOTE
This project has been set up with Vue3 (Not Nuxt 3) and Nest.js with Graphql. It has a hello world graphql and REST endpoint.
